# License

This library uses the MIT license. In plain words, this means that you
can reuse it in both opensource and proprietary projects; the only
requirement is that you keep the license text with each source file,
where it already is. This is for my protection: the license text
basically says that whatever happens, it's not my fault, and you
understand it.
